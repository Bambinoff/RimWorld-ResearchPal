# FAQ
### *Can I add/remove this from an existing save?*

You can add it to existing saves without problems. Removing this mod will lead to some errors when loading, but these should not affect gameplay - and will go away after saving.

### *Why is research X in position Y?*

Lonely unconnected researches will be found on top. The rest follows a stacking algorithm. 

### *Can I use this with mod X*

Should work with everything, even alongside ResearchTree. They'll have different queues though.

### *This looks very similar to ResearchTree*

This is a fork, Fluffy's ResearchTree is the upstream project, there are minor but important differences between those two projects.
ResearchPal offers a denser layout and builds it as RimWorld starts. Less scrolling for the user and in my experience no slowdowns or lag.
